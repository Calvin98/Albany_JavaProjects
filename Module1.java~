 * This program will reverse strings and check for palindromes, the code will first
 * ask the user to enter a string to reverse or "done" to exit. If the user enters a string
 * then the code will use a recursive algorithm and implementation to reverse the string. If
 * the original and reversed strings are the same then the program will indicate that it is a 
 * palindrome. The program will then ask for another string and do the same until the user 
 * enters "done" to exit.
